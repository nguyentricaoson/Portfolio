## [Project 1: Terrorism Hotspots Project (Data Analysis and Visualization)](https://github.com/nguyentricaoson/Data_project/tree/main/Terrorism)

Imagine you are a security or defense analyst. Analyze the data and draw conclusions on the distribution and nature of terrorist incidents recorded around the world. In your analysis, include maps that visualize the location of different incidents. Your analysis may also provide answers to the following questions:

1. How has the number of terrorist activities changed over the years? Are there certain regions where this trend is different from the global averages?
2. Is the number of incidents and the number of casualties correlated? Can you spot any irregularities or outliers?
3. What are the most common methods of attacks? Does it differ in various regions or in time?
4. Plot the locations of attacks on a map to visualize their regional spread

You are also free to explore the data further and extract additional insights other than the questions above.

## [Project 2: Delivery Duration Prediction Project (Data Science and Machine Learning)](https://github.com/nguyentricaoson/Data_project/tree/main/DoorDash)

When a consumer places an order on DoorDash, we show the expected time of delivery. It is very important for DoorDash to get this right, as it has a big impact on consumer experience. In this exercise, you will build a model to predict the estimated time taken for a delivery.

Build a model to predict the total delivery duration seconds (as defined above). Feel free to generate additional features from the given data to improve model performance. Explain:
- Model(s) used,
- How you evaluated your model performance on the historical data,
- Any data processing you performed on the data,
- Feature engineering choices you made,
- Other information you would like to share your modeling approach.
